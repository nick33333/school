Check divergence between ref genome and GCA_017834975.1_ASM1783497v1_genomic.US.fna

NOTES: 
- paftools.js is from the minimap2 package
- Pipeline makes use of Snakemake and conda environments
- samples dir is to be filled with .fna (fasta) files of whole genome assemblies
- ref dir should contain reference genome assembly and associated index file (.fai)
- conda environment from envs should be created by user and activated before calling snakemake
